                <strong> Why should you work on side projects?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to build yourself a stellar resume is to build side projects. I personally find working on 
                side projects to be a better way to get jobs than crunching on data structures and algorithms like you are preparing for 
                IIT-JEE. I personally have spent more time hacking on side projects and this has directly influenced my career.
                <br><br>
                (That said I do not despise learning data structures and algorithms. I just couldn't get myself to enjoy competetive programming. 
                Also this doesn't mean I never studied them either. I have done my own fair share of Hackerrank grinding in the weeks leading up to interviews.
                I'm not saying it is useless, just that there are other fun ways to upskill yourself)
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why is project based learning the best way to learn?</strong> 
                <br><br>
                Imagine the time you tried programming for the first time. You might probably have followed some tutorial or lesson that made you 
                execute a 'Hello World' program. This is the case with most of the programming tutorials out there which teaches the language by 
                <i>teaching the syntax</i>. 
                
                The problem with learning the syntax is that the learning is based on memorization and not application. I get that there is a minimum 
                amount of syntax that you need to know before you can start thinking in terms of building products, but what I'm trying to convey is the mindset.
                <br><br>
                Let us look at the examples of two imaginary students trying to learn web development to demonstrate this.
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Arun is new to programming and software development. He wishes to learn web development and has started learning the basics of HTML and CSS 
                    from watching tutorials on YouTube. He ends up following a tutorial that teaches HTML tags by showing examples of each tag and its properties instead
                    of a complete example website. Although Arun finished the tutorial and learnt all the different tags he doesn't feel like he built anything. After a few days
                    of taking a break, Arun feels like he has forgot most of what he learnt and needs to revise it again.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                In such a scenario Arun's time and knowledge is not wasted. If he follows up his studies by trying to build something on his own whatever he learnt would 
                be reinforced. 
                <br><br>
                Let us look at another case
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    Ananya is interested in learning web development after seeing one of her senior's work online. She is thinking of ideas to implement in her college
                    like building a website for the Ladies' Hostel to help with collecting the mess fees. 
                    She starts learning HTML from a video tutorial. She keeps the video as a reference, and starts building a mock version of her application 
                    on her own. She refers to the video and searches for more information about the HTML tags in the internet as she is building her application. In the end she has a full
                    UI for her app and whatever she learnt was reinforced as there was more application than memorization while learning.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                These are just two examples to demonstrate the different approaches one could have while learning programming.
                Apart from all these, building side projects can be beneficial for your career in other ways too. You can meet potential cofounders, grow an audience and achieve monthly/annual recurring revenue for your product or even
                get acqui-hired depending on the scale of your application. 
                <br><br>
                If you are someone who has previously worked on your own side projects or even if you have atleast tried to build something, let me ask you to remember the first time 
                you started building something and try to bring back that feeling of inspiration in you. The first time you got stuck with some error which you didn't understand, searching 
                for its solution all over stackoverflow and finally experiencing the joy when you finally solved it. Remember feeling so smart and being proud of yourself then? I hope that memory 
                inspires you to start tinkering on something again.
                <br><br>
                If you are someone who has never worked on any side projects yet, I hope I have inspired you to start building something for yourself. Even all the resume and career stuff aside,
                the process of making something from start to finish can be a highly rewarding one. You should definitely try it atleast once while you are still a student. I know that this article has 
                not done justice to the general idea of side hustles, so here are some of the resources I have been inspired by to work on my own projects.
