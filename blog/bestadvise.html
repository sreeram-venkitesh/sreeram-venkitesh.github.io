               <strong>Some of the best advise I've recieved</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Here are some good advises I've got that I want to pass on to others.</p>

            <p><strong>"Dabble more in text based operating systems"</strong> - 2018</p>
            <p>
                This was told to me by a senior while when I first tried using the Raspberry Pi. I was using Windows as my daily driver then.
                I didn't understand why anyone would want to use a terminal over a GUI back then, but I realised the importance of this after I 
                started using Linux as my main operating system.
            </p>

            <p><strong>"Attend lots of hackathons and build networks. Will do wonders in your career trust me."</strong> - 2019</p>
            <p>
                Self explanatory. The amount of opportunities you will get scales with the size of your network.
            </p>
