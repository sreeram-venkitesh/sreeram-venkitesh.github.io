            <p>
                Testing someone's computer proficiency with problems based on data structures and algorithms is pretty much an
                industry standard now and it is getting saturated by the day. 
                <br><br>
                What do I mean by saturated? Imagine you have a group of ten people applying for a position. You give them a pretty
                basic problem to solve. You can pretty much compare the proficiency of these 10 people by looking at how they approach
                even the simplest of the problems. Scale this up to a hundred people, you might have to increase the difficulty to easily
                filter out the best candidates. Now imagine how you would filter the best candidates from hundreds of thousands of graduates
                from all over a nation.
                <br><br>
                If the only solution for filtering good candidates from an ever increasing pool of applicants is to keep on increasing the 
                difficulty of the test, it gets inefficient really quick. 
                <br><br>
                Even if hardworking students from Tier-3 colleges spend a majority of their college years grinding problems from Leetcode and 
                Hackerrank, they would find very little use of the very specific skill they spent years acquiring after cracking their interviews.
                Unless you are someone who is into competetive programming, training yourself to be able to solve a very specific kind of problems
                in limited amount of time wouldn't help you very much in solving the problems you might face in real life. 
                <br><br>
                A better way to prove your skills would be to work on side projects. Showing that you are able to work on a project from the start 
                to finish would be more valuable for potential employers and you get to work on a wider range of ideas and fields of study.
