My primary interests are computers, programming and learning. I like to read about stuff that I find interesting and also like to work on projects from time to time. Right now I'm working on a site that will recommend you podcasts based on your answers to certain questions that will calculate your interest in different topics

Before this I built [quarantineresu.me](https://quarantineresu.me), a site to show off the stuff you did during while being in lockdown during the pandemic. I also built [honeybee](https://github.com/fillerink/honeybee). Checkout my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/fillerInk)

I have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I post educational content and vlogs and interviews with people from when I went to hackathons and conferences and such events. 

Apart form this, I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Mar Athanasius College of Engineering

If you're still reading this, you might also be interested to checkout [my projects](/projects) or read [my blog](/post). If you want to stay in touch and get updates of what I'm doing, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fillerInk)
