__Intermediate Rails__ is a compilation of some of the other blog posts I've made regarding Rails. These include the stuff that I learnt after studying the [Learn Ruby on Rails](https://www.bigbinary.com/learn-rubyonrails-book) book by [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com).

- [Using services in your Rails projects](/blog/rails-services)

- [Using devise for user authentication in Rails](/blog/devise)

- [Making a simple blog application in Rails with Devise](/blog/devise-blog)
