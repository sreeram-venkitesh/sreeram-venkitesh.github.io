This post is a part of the [Rails in Production](/blog/rails-in-production) series and aims to give a general introduction about devops with Rails. This post assumes that you have a basic working knowledge of how a Rails application works.

## Creating your server

- In this guide, we will be using DigitalOcean to create our cloud servers. You can sign up [here](https://m.do.co/c/181c46062f57) and avail $100 worth of credits. 
- DigitalOcean calls their VMs Droplets. A droplet is essentially a linux server that you can configure and deploy your project to. There are several different types of droplets, but for the sake of this guide we are going to be using the most basic one.
- Sign up at DigitalOcean, create a new project and click the `Droplet` option from the `Create` menu

</p>
- Select Ubuntu 20.04 as your operating system when creating the droplet.

</p>
- Setup the authentication by adding your public SSH key. If you haven't generated an SSH key yet, you can follow the instructions given.
<p align="center">
![Setting up the SSH key](/static/images/devops/DO_ssh.png)
</p>
- Once you've done all this and created the server, you will be be able to login to the remote server from the terminal in your local machine like so
```bash
ssh root@ip
```
- While logging in for the first time, it'll ask you if you'd like to add this host to the list of known hosts. You can say yes to this. Once you've logged in to your newly created remote server, you essentially get full control of the server, through its terminal. You can now mess around with this computer, installing packages cloning your files into it etc.
- Notice that we have logged in to the server as the root user. If you run `ls -all` you'll be able to see a `.ssh` directory in the `/root` directory where you are right now. Inside this `.ssh` directory you will find an `authorized_keys` file. You will notice that your SSH key is stored inside this file. You were able to SSH into this server as the root user because your public SSH key is present in this file (If it weren't you'd have gotten a `Permission Denied (public key)`) error).

## Creating a new user
- Let us now try creating a new user in our server.
- Login to your remote server as the `root` user.
- Your ssh key would be present in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and this is how you are able to access the server remotely.
- Add new user with the following command. You can give whatever username you prefer.
```bash
sudo adduser sreeram
```
- At this point, if you open a new terminal session and try logging into the server as the newly added user, you will get the above mentioned Permission Denied error. This is because we have not added our SSH key to the `authorized_keys` file inside the new user's home directory yet.
- Navigate to `.ssh/authorized_keys` file inside `/home/sreeram` while you are still logged in as the root user and add your public SSH key to the file.
- Try logging into the server once you've added your SSH key to `/home/sreeram/.ssh/authorized_keys`
```bash
ssh sreeram@ip
```
- You will be able to login as the new user

## Setting up the new user
Now that we have created a new user and are able to login to the server, let us configure the new user.

- Add `sreeram` to the sudoers file by running the following command 
```bash
usermod -aG sudo sreeram
``` 
- Now `sreeram` user can run commands that require admin privileges by adding `sudo`.
- Let us now add the user to the `/etc/sudoers` file to be able to use sudo without having to enter the password. Currently if you try to run a command as the superuser, you will be prompted to enter your password. This may cause a trouble if we are trying to run a script in the server using tools like Ansible.

- Run the following command
```bash
sudo visudo
```

This will open the `/etc/sudoers` file. Add the following line at the end of the file (You can replaced `sreeram` with the username of the user to whom which you wanna enable passwordless sudo).

```bash
%sreeram ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Save the file and you should now be able to use superuser privileges without having to enter your password.

## Configuring Firewall

Run the following commands if you wanna enable firewall with `ufw`
```bash
sudo ufw status
```
This command can be used to get the status of Firewall in your server. You can use this to check if firewall is enabled or not.

**Enabling and disabling firewall**

Enable firewall by running the following command
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

**Adding applications to firewall**

Once you have added firewall, you can configure different applications that make use of the network and add "application profiles" to define how it should work. This includes blocking certain IP addresses, allowing SSH connections and so on.

**List all available application profiles**
```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

**Enable new application profiles**

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

This is only a very basic guide to what you can do with ufw. [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands) is a much more detailed post on using ufw from the DigitalOcean blog.

## Installing dependencies 

Now that we have set up the server and you are able to access it, you can SSH into the remote server and install different software that you will need to deploy your application. In this post, we will be installing and configuring everything manually, but keep in mind that going forward we'll be automating all of this. We would be able to set up a server that is ready for deploying our application by runninng a single command.

**Install node, yarn, ruby, rails**

Install `nvm` and the desired `node` version after that 

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

Logout of the server and log in again to use nvm

Then

```bash
nvm install 16.4.2
```

Install `yarn` 

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```

Test this out by running 

```bash
yarn -v
```

---

**Install rbenv and ruby**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Add the ruby-build plugin for rbenv

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

Now check the available ruby versions

```bash
rbenv install --list
```

Now you can install ruby by running

```bash
rbenv install 3.0.2
```

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Run this to set 3.0.2 as the default ruby version

```bash
rbenv global 3.0.2
```

---

**Install rails**

```bash
gem install rails --no-document -v 6.1.4.1
```

**Install puma**

```bash
gem install puma -v 5.5.2
```

Install whatever version of puma you have defined in your applicationâ€™s `Gemfile.lock` file.

---

**Install postgres**

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```

Now postgres is installed and is running. A default role name `postgres` will be created. 

You can access the postgres shell by running the following

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Or you can manually get into the postgres user and then running psql

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres

psql
```

---

**Install nginx**

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

After installing and starting nginx, you should be greeted with the nginx homepage if you visit your server's public IP in a browser. You can either edit the default nginx config or add your own to point it to you application once you got it running in the server. For example you can point it to your Puma process ID file or a specific port at which your application is running.
