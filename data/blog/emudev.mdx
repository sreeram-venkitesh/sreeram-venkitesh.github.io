Developing emulators is a great side project and is one of the best ways to learn **CPU architecture and design**. This post is a collection of some good resources I've come across during the time I went down this rabbit hole.

I used to keep a specific bookmarks folder for emudev. Since then I had shared this list of resources as a document to many people &#8212; friends to whom I brought up the topic of emulation development and at talks I have given where I discussed about emulators. This blog post is to keep all my resources in an orderly manner. Going forward I will be updating this post with whatever I discover. Happy hacking!

I sure had a lot of fun learning about the different hardware architectures and felt a new level of appreciation to how these gaming consoles work. I wish you all the best if you are thinking of building an console emulator as a side project!
