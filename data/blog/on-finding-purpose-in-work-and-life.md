[Wiliam Shanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shanks) was an amateur mathematician who is famous for his calculation of the first 707 digits of Pi in the year of 1873. However, Shanks made a mistake at the 528th decimal and all the calculations he made afterwards was wrong. This was later discovered in 1944 by mathematician D F Ferguson, using a mechanical calculator. Similar to how Sisyphus returning to his rock interests Camus, I'm interested in the period of William Shanks' life which was spent calculating Pi throughout the 528th to the 707th decimal places. The fact that the days, months or even years you spent working on something was all for nothing gives me existential dread. 

The year of 2023 is the first time in my life where I was working on a single project throughout the entirety of the year. As some of you reading this might know, that project is [neetoDeploy](https://neeto.com/neetodeploy), the cloud deployment platform as a service we're building at BigBinary. Although I always want to be working on something that I find intriguing throughout my career, I somehow secretly wish that neetoDeploy should be the work of my life. The highlight of my career if that makes sense Kind of like what Sam Altman say's in his post, [How to be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful), *"...*I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote".  

neetoDeploy is my answer to Aaron Swartz's quote that goes "What is the most important thing you could be working on in the world right now?". Building a cloud deployment platform is the most important thing that I can see myself working on (And I admit [this didn't happen one fine day](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes)). Computers are getting more accessible every day and the number of applications deployed on the cloud is only going to go up, never down. And at this point in my life everything is revolving around this holy grail of crafting the best cloud deployment experience. I can't say how I will think of this ten years down the line though. Maybe reminisce the early days of the cloud platform. Maybe cringe a little at my old notes or conference talks.

Let's look at William Shanks again. Imagine a day in his life during the period in which he was making wrong calculations. Imagine how he'd have woken up and gone about his life. He must've had great productive days and days where he slacked off, all during the period where he was doing calculations to produce gibberish. I wonder if he must've thought if his calculation had gone wrong at some point in the past, rendering all his work useless. One may never know, but I'd like to argue that he never thought so. He passionately worked on his calculations everyday because that's what gave him purpose in life. That was for him the most important thing that he could be working on. On a positive note, Shanks died not knowing that he made a mistake in his calculation. If nothing, his mistake only made him more famous.
