2023 has been the first year of my life where I was working on a single project throughout the entirety of the year. As some of you reading this might know, that project is [neetoDeploy](https://neeto.com/neetodeploy), the cloud deployment platform as a service we're building at BigBinary.

I've been trying to get myself into a habit of writing regularly for quite some time now. It's weird how our brains work when it comes to priorities and the things you want to get done. In multiple occasions I've found that the deadline imposed by an outside entity such as an employer automatically gets more priority in my brain compared to deadlines I've kept for myself. For this reason, I always end up choosing to work on company or open source work over personal projects, even though those are really exciting too. If you're someone who has faced similar situations, the way to get yourself started on the path of getting it done is to think about how you can reduce the static friction associated with getting started with your task. Most of the times, there might be something that keeps you from working on your project after a long day of other tasks. If you are able to automate away most of the boilerplate work, you can focus all your energy on the creative aspect of it. For my blog, this was setting up [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/ "TinaCMS"). With TinaCMS, I only need to think about what I need to write and not worry about the logistics required to get the content published.
