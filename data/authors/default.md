I'm 22 year old who is passionate about technology and software developement. I like to [build cool shit](/projects) and to [talk](/talks) about the things I've learnt. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com).

My interests include reading, meeting people, anime, video games and amateur astronomy. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I post videos related to technology.
