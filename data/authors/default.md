I'm 22 year old who is passionate about technology and software developement. I find pleasure in learning new things and building projects I care about. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer at BigBinary.

My interests include reading, meeting people, anime, video games and [amateur astronomy](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/clear-skies). I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I post videos related to technology.
