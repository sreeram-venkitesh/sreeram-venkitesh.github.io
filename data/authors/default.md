I'm 24 year old who is passionate about technology and software developement. I like to [build cool shit](/projects) and to [talk](/talks) about the things I've learnt. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com) where I'm building the next best alternative to Heroku, [neetoDeploy](https://neeto.com/neetodeploy).

My interests include reading, meeting new people, anime, video games and [amateur astronomy](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/clear-skies/). I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I post videos related to technology. You can also follow me on Twitter at [@fillerInk](https://twitter.com/fillerInk)
