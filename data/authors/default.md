I'm a 25 year old who is passionate about the craft of building software. I like to [build cool shit](/projects) and to [talk](/talks) about the things I've learnt. Previously I used to work as a Software Engineer at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com) where I was building [NeetoDeploy](https://neeto.com/neetodeploy), a platform as a service for deploying your apps on the cloud. Currently I'm on an [open source sabbatical](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/03/28/open-source-sabbatical---awesome/).

I'm an active contributor to the Kubernetes project. I was part of the release team from [v1.29](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.29/release-team.md) to [v1.32](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.32/release-team.md) and I was the [enhancements sub team lead for v1.31](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.31/release-team.md). I also maintain and write the [Last Week in Kubernetes Development newsletter](https://lwkd.info) every week. See my entire list of contributions to Kubernetes [here](/kubernetes).

My interests include reading, philosophy, traveling and meeting new people, anime, video games and [amateur astronomy](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/clear-skies/). I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I (used to) post videos related to technology. If you'd like to receive updates on my new blogs and the interesting things I come across, you can subscribe to my [newsletter](/newsletter).
