I'm 24 year old who is passionate about the craft of building software. I like to [build cool shit](/projects) and to [talk](/talks) about the things I've learnt. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com) where I'm building [neetoDeploy](https://neeto.com/neetodeploy), a Platform as a Service for deploying your apps on the cloud. I'm also an active contributor to the Kubernetes project. I was part of the [v1.29](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.29/release-team.md) and [v1.30](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.30/release-team.md) Release Team as a shadow in the enhancements team. I also maintain and write the [Last Week in Kubernetes Development newsletter](https://lwkd.info) every week.

My interests include reading, philosophy, traveling and meeting new people, anime, video games and [amateur astronomy](https://sreeram-venkitesh.github.io/clear-skies/). I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sreeramvenkitesh) where I post videos related to technology.
