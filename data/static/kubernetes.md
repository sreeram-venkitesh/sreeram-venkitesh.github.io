  <h2>Hi from KubeCon!</h2>
  <p>If you're here, you're probably attending KubeCon NA at Salt Lake City right now! Hope you're having a great time at the conference!</p>
  <p>I'm currently in between jobs and I'm looking for new opportunities which are closely aligned with Kubernetes, the CNCF ecosystem and open source. I've been contributing to Kubernetes for the past two years and I'm gaining more momentum these days. You can find my full resume [here](/sreeram-venkitesh-resume.pdf).</p>
  <p> Please feel free to email me at `sreeram [at] hey [dot] com` if you think I can bring more value to your organization! Thanks! </p>

I've been involved with the Kuberentes and CNCF open source ecosystem for over 2 years now. This page serves as a running log for all my upstream contributions. This is inspired by [Priyanka Saggu's Kubernetes contributions page](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes.html). If you want to start reading from the beginning, click [here](#2022)
